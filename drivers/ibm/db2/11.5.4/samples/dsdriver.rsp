*To select features and settings to install, uncomment the corresponding keywords
*and specify values for those keywords. You do not need to select features for the
*TYPICAL or COMPACT installation options.

*Comments are made by placing either an asterisk (*) or a number sign (#) at the start of a line, or by
*placing ** or ## after the start of a line to comment out the rest of that line.

*All keywords that are currently uncommented (i.e. not preceded by *) are mandatory and must be 
*specified in order for the installation to continue. All other keywords are optional. If optional keywords are
*not specified, the installation will proceed using default values.

* General Options
* ---------------
PROD                 = IBM_DATA_SERVER_DRIVER
LIC_AGREEMENT        = DECLINE   **You must change this to ACCEPT to indicate your acceptance of the license agreement before continuing.
FILE                 = C:\Program Files\IBM\IBM DATA SERVER DRIVER 
** FILE determines the base install path.  If you specify a path that does not
** yet have this product, this will install a new copy.  If you specify a path
** that does not have this product, this will be considered an "existing"
** install intended to install additional functionality.  This is an optional
** keyword. 

*Select Features
*---------------------------------------------
*Select the features that you want to install by uncommenting the corresponding COMP keywords. 
*COMP                          = ODBC_SUPPORT

** Copy Name
** ---------
** The copy name is the identifier used to refer to a single instance of an 
** installation of IBM database products.  You can also choose to use this copy 
** as the default IBM database client interface copy. If so, the IBM database 
** client interface (ODBC/CLI driver and .Net data provider) in the copy is as 
** the default drivers used by applications. 
*COPY_NAME    = IBMDBCL                          ** char(64)
*DEFAULT_CLIENT_INTERFACE_COPY = NO              ** YES or NO. Default is NO unless this is the only copy installed.

** Migrate catalog to xml
** ---------------------
** Specify whether you want to create a catalog configuration file from the 
** existing DB2 default copy. The configuration file is used by the IBM Data
** Server Driver Package to connect to a supported database. Specifying this
** keyword creates a configuration file containing the contents of the local
** database directory, node directory, and DCS directory of a specific database 
** manager instance.
*MIGRATE_CATALOG_TO_XML   = FALSE              ** FALSE or TRUE

** Common Application Data Top Path
** --------------------------------
** The keyword DB2_COMMON_APP_DATA_TOP_PATH can be used to specify the
** customized top directory of common application data path under which the sub
** directory IBM\\DB2\\\<COPY_NAME\> will be created to hold the common
** application data specific to the installation copy. \<COPY_NAME\> is the
** copy name for the current installation. If the keyword is not used, the
** default common application data path will be used. This keyword is valid
** only for the first time installation in a location which has no previously
** installed products.
*DB2_COMMON_APP_DATA_TOP_PATH =             ** a full path


** DSDRIVER file configuration through install(input from the user)
** ----------------------------------------------------------------

** The DB2DSDRIVER_CFG_SOURCE_PATH keyword identifies the location of a 
** customized db2dsdriver.cfg file provided by the user. Applicable for silent install only.
*DB2DSDRIVER_CFG_SOURCE_PATH =              ** a full file path

** The DB2_ODBC_DSN_TYPE keyword identifies the type of DSN to be
** registered. Applicable for silent install only.
*DB2_ODBC_DSN_TYPE        =                 ** USER,SYSTEM or BOTH

** The DB2_ODBC_DSN_ACTION keyword specifies whether to add or replace DSNs during registration. Applicable for silent install only.
*DB2_ODBC_DSN_ACTION      =                 ** ADD OR REPLACE


** Copy the Optim Performance Manager Extended Insight (OPM EI) library files during installation
** ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

** This keyword will take the path of the OPM EI bulk deploy root directory as input. 
** When provided with the path, the installer will copy the files from java directory 
** to DSDRIVER installation directory where jcc(db2jcc4.jar) libraries are present 
** and all non-java library contents from the respective platform directory to DSDRIVER
** installation directory where cli libraries ( db2app.dll ) are present.  
*EI_BULK_DEPLOY_ROOT_DIRECTORY =            **location of the OPM EI bulk deploy root directory
